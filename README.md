# CMIP5 and North Atlantic Jet Variability

This piece of work is part of a broader analysis performed on the North Atlantic Climate Variability and the ability of contemporary models to accurately predict it. The project took place under the supervision of Dr. Paulo Ceppi, as part of the Undergaduate Research Opportunity Placement (2021) at the Department of Physics, Imperial College London. 

**Motivation**: Global mean temperature at the Earthâ€™s surface responds both to externally imposed forcings, such as those arising from anthropogenic greenhouse gases, as well as to naturally-occurring patterns of atmospheric and oceanic variability. The latter, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), orchestrate variations in weather and climate over much of the globe on inter annual and longer time scales. 

The NAO is measured using a south(Azores)-minus-north(Iceland) index of atmospheric surface pressure variation across the NA and is closely connected with changes in the North Atlantic atmospheric polar jet stream and wider changes in atmospheric circulation. The physical, human, and biological impacts of NAO changes extend well beyond weather and climate, with major economic, social, and environmental effects. 

Recent studies have highlighted that a large proportion of contemporary climate models exhibit too weak multi-decadal twentieth century NA climate variability when compared to observations. Diagnostics of the regional NA eddy-driven tropospheric westerly jet can help to improve understanding of key drivers and impacts of NAO variability.

Fig. 1: Historical winter mean U850 (line contours) and regression slopes (color fill) of time series of winter mean U850 at each grid point on (left) NAO index, (middle) jet latitude and (right) strength. 
All time series were linearly detrended prior to calculation of regression slopes.

Figure 1 shows the climatological winter mean lower tropospheric westerly wind structure of the NA region, 
for which strengthening and poleward shifting of the jet
are both associated with a more positive NAO. A key point is that for a given change in the NAO the impacts or drivers of that change
depend strongly on the ratio of associated jet shifting and/or strengthening, which exhibit contrasting spatial 
correlation patterns with local westerly wind across the NA and over Europe (compare Figures 1 (mid) and (right)). 
  
This motivates us to carry out an analysis of NA jet variability across the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models to help identify to what extent are the observed variations reproduced across the CMIP5 historical simulations.
